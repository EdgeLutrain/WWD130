      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>The Why and The Main Page</h3>
      <p>
        The main page will be a display of the favorite pieces the Artist has done with the name of their website or the company they operate. A little bio about who they are and what type are they like. Have separate links to an FAQ, the gallery, and a contact page about commissions, the limitations, and the basic fees related to them.

        People will visit the site due to their interest in the Artist who would have this page set up. They often come from social media platforms to check out their work. It'll help them generate Commission leads as people look to understand their rates and what's possible from them. Expect questions like What type of art do they do? How much will you charge per the level of detail? Who is this Artist? And how do I get in contact with them to do commissions? We want them to be able to explore what the artists' previous works are. So that they have examples of understanding what they're capable of in the styles. Have some satisfied customer remarks about their art piece and the experience of getting a Commission. Have a frequently asked question form so they can resolve questions themselves if they are shy to reach out. Either a form to fill out to send to the Artist so they can reach out to the potential Commission or have details about how to contact him. Along with telling what they'll need to help get their Commission started as soon as possible. Ultimately, completing these actions requires going to the site. It acts as a FAQ form for the artists, and displaying it was possible. They were showing a Commission sheet of varying levels of detail and what they charge. It would be up to the Artist to not allow it to be subverted as they would save them a bunch of time answering repetitive questions and standardizing what is needed to begin the Commission process through the website.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Commission and Artist Focused</h3>
      <p>
        Now the Commission page, the contact page, it would be interesting to make a form page where they put in the information, but sometimes uh, with a discussion of artists, I know they often prefer to be contacted through official channels meaning, for example, one of my friends says they like to be preferred to contact through Discord or Instagram. And on this page, we will have the actual Commission sheet, which is just a basic layout of standard forms of commissionsâ€”explaining how payment and designs will occur. What's going to be required from the customer to begin the Commission so, like concept photos and detailed descriptions that need to be messaged to the Artist? So that when they reach out, she can look at it and understand what they're asking clearly. So they can simply, without too much hassle back and forth, declare if she'll be able to do the Commission or if it's something outside of their possibility. \n

        Hopefully, this website will work, unlike a website like Fiverr or trying to post that information through a social media platform like Instagram. The goal is that they can have ultimate control over the design and what is displayed. They don't have to update multiple different sites repeatedly; it's a simple link and all their BIOS. Saying interested in commissions, visit my site so that they can outline the details about what they will do for commissions and be able to display it so that customers can have an example of what's possible.

      </ul>
      <h3>The FAQ page</h3>
      <p>
        The FAQ will be designed more as an overflowing document to keep adding two questions that keep occurring or new questions that they find prevalent to the situation about their Commission and their art style. Understanding what category certain commissions fall into. Helping answer questions to those customers. In the gallery, we'll display favorite pieces, some comments from the customer about their satisfaction with these pieces, and some artist remarks. Helping them understand they are the enjoyment the process and showing that an artist can be reliable in delivering their needs.

        Ultimately, this website will be the one-stop shop for displaying Commission pieces, as it will act as a gallery that can add photos. Along with giving descriptions of what some of these pieces are. With especially digital art as the main focus, there are so many varying types of art you can do. As a good example, someone can Commission an artist to do a set of emojis to be applied to Discord as they allow personal emojis to be used within communities. So creating a repository to establish that information without having to keep it separately on their phone memorizing is primarily the goal of this website is to condense that information.
